As I've always been interested in cryptography and cybersecurity, I started working on it a bit while at Hacker School, mainly by working on the challenges in the [Microcorruption](http://microcorruption.com) capture the flag game.

Today, thanks to [Filippo](http://filippo.io) (also the guy behind the extremely popular and valuable [Heartbleed vulnerability tester](http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/)), I ran across the [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/), a series of challenges that looks similar in nature to Capture the Flag.

If you're at all interested in doing this as well, let me know.  Looks like a lot of fun.
