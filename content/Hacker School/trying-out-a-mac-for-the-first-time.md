While I know it will seem crazy to many, I've never been a Mac guy--so much so that I've barely ever used one, and I really don't know any of the shortcuts or how the OS works.

After blowing up my personal computer by trying to dual-boot Linux (which I finally got working and do actually find myself liking), I realized I do actually need a new computer, and so I started shopping around for one that would be an adequate replacement.  I also looked around Hacker School to see what everyone else had, and to my surprise, it was 90% Macs, with maybe a couple ThinkPads with Linux installed on them.  I'm pretty sure I was the only one using Windows.  

So, betraying my family tradition of using only PCs, I ordered a refurbished MacBook Pro 13" (256GB SSD, 8GB RAM) to give it a try.  I just picked it up today at the Apple Store.

I will say, it is definitely a beautiful machine.
###The good
####Applications
I'm impressed with a number of the applications that came with the computer, paritcularly GarageBand and iMovie--those are pieces of software that would be relatively expensive to get on a PC, or would require getting an open source but confusing download.
I was also pleasantly surprised by the existence of a Messaging app built-in that syncs perfectly with iMessage on the iPhone.  I can send a message from my computer to iPhones, or even to Facebook Chat or any other Jabber service. 
I have, however, been very frustrated with a number of things.

###The Bad
####Differences between Windows and Mac
 + I couldn't believe even the keyboard was different.  There's no Delete key, only the Backspace.  There's a Command *and* a Control key, and it's not clear which shortcuts get which, and philosophy seems to differ by program.
 + Finder, which is supposed to be the equivalent of File Explorer, doesn't have the same path bar as in Windows so that I can type in the path I want and just go straight to it.
 
 
 ####Things that just aren't working
 For Macs supposedly being devices that "just work," I've had a lot of problems so far.
  + Frequently when I try to access anything on the menu bar--e.g., airplay mirroring, sound, date-time--it crashes and gives me the Spinning Circle of Death, and only responds five or so minutes later.  Sound has been the biggest issue with this, since my computer seems to not be playing any sound, but I actually can't tell if the issue is with the computer, the output is going somewhere else, or if the sound is just low, since the volume configurer is completely unresponsive.  Even using the volume lower and higher buttons on the function part of the keyboard take about five minutes to respond.
